# My Notes Application Overview

"My Notes" is a straightforward web application designed for users to easily manage their personal list of notes.

## Key Features

-   **Add Notes**: Users can add new notes through a dedicated `Add` option in the top navigation bar.
-   **Recent Notes Display**: The homepage (or a dedicated section) will immediately display the 5 most recently added notes for quick access.
-   **All Notes View**: A `Notes` tab in the navigation allows users to view all their notes, ordered from newest to oldest.

## Design Process

The development of "My Notes" followed a structured design approach to ensure a user-friendly and scalable interface:

-   **Wireframing**: Initial low-fidelity wireframes were created to define the basic layout, content hierarchy, and user flow of the application.
-   **Pixel-Perfect Design**: High-fidelity, pixel-perfect design mockups were then developed (e.g., using a tool like **Figma**) to finalize the visual aesthetics, typography, color palette, and overall user experience before implementation.

## Technology Stack

This application is built using fundamental web development concepts and the following technologies:

-   **Frontend**:
    -   `HTML`: For structuring the web content.
    -   `CSS`: For styling the application's user interface, ensuring a clean and minimalist look. The styling adheres to **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** principles for a meaningful, modular, and scalable CSS structure.
-   **Backend**:
    -   `Python`: Serving as the primary programming language.
    -   `Flask`: The lightweight web framework for handling routes and application logic.
    -   `Jinja2`: Used for dynamic templating of HTML pages, allowing Python variables to be embedded directly into HTML.

## Educational Context

This project is a practical application of the knowledge gained from a Flask and Python course. It serves as:

-   A personal project to reinforce learned concepts.
-   A demonstrative and educational tool for programming students, showcasing basic web application development principles.
